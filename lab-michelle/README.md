# Lab 22: Reddit Scraper

## What This Thing Should Do:
There should be three components: App, SearchForm, SearchResultList. SearchForm is a search bar from which a user can search for a reddit board. Results should populate into SearchResultList and both of these components should be rendered in App.

When you search a topic that isn't valid (spelled wrong, there are no boards for it), the search box should turn red to indicate an error.
